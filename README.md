### Capstone Project - Lending Club Data - Predicting Return on Investment for Investors

This project explores using Lending Club Data to predict Return on Investments for Loans, allowing investors to choose loans with a higher return and lower risk of loss due to defaults. The approach to this project was to predict how much the loans will return (regression), rather than whether or not a loan will default (classification).
